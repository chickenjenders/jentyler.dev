        <h1>Guilty Masks</h1>
        <p>
          Unmask your friends' secrets in this CYOA Twine game! Your friend has
          left behind a strange letter to let you and the rest of the guests
          know that she has learned of one of your betrayals. She knows your
          secrets and she's blackmailing all of you into coming clean about who
          went behind her back. Figure out what's at stake, or don't, either way
          someone will have to take the blame.<br />
          <br />For my graduate course project, I created a
          choose-your-own-adventure story using Twine. The game was made to
          utilize the CYOA genre in interactive fiction. I wanted to story to be
          suspenseful and intrigue players to be lead down several paths with
          various endings<br />
          <br />This was a really fun project I made utlizing HTML, CSS, and
          even javascript aspects of Twine's SugarCube format. I also was able
          to add fun and unique images to the game using Dall-E 3. I'd really
          love to expand more on this project and make it even more interactive
          with more twists and turns to the story plot. Currently, there are 6
          endings, which one will you end on?
