        <p>
          Can you defeat the dragon in this RPG web game? Using freeCodeCamp's
          certification course for <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"
            class="links">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure</a
          >, I was able to follow along to build the majority of the
          role-playing game. This project utilizes many of the most popular and
          useful elements of javascript such as arrays, objects, and loops.<br
          />
          <br /> After completing the course project, I decided to alter some aspects
          of the game to make the playing experience more consistent and fun. I also
          decided to add visuals to the game using Dall-E 3. Simple changes and creative
          additives made this game more unqiuely my own and improved overall player
          experience.
