      <br />
      Waiting Room is a short psychological horror game about guilt and acceptance.
      The game is made using Bitsy, a very limited game engine that requires creative
      solutions to utlize its full potential to create the game you want. I wanted
      to emit the discomfort and anxiety of guilt through the engine's styling, color
      palettes, and sound design.
      <br />
      <br />I used Bitsy hacks by Sean Leblanc in order to add the sounds used
      in the game, as well as to match the HTML background to the game's theme.
      Lastly, I modified an existing hack called "follower" that uses JavaScript
      to have a sprite(s) follow the player around the game. Using a BFS
      algorithm, along with some other changes to the code, I was able to
      simulate the sprites in a room chasing the player each time the player
      moves.<br />
      <br /> The game is a short experience, but I hope it leaves a lasting impression
      on the player. Its also now available to play on itch.io!
