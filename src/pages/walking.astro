      <h1>Why Walk?</h1>
      <p>
        Why isn't there an educational game about walkable cities? Oh wait, now
        there is!<br />

        "Why Walk?" places the player in a city with a handful of issues
        hindering a city's walkability. As the player explores each of them,
        they learn how each element impact the city's walkability and how to fix
        them. <br />
        <br />The game was designed to be simplistic to target a younger
        audience for educational purposes. The project is completely written in
        JavaScript using P5.play library. Assets were obtained through free
        online sources. <br />
        <br />I'm interested in further improving this game with added
        interactivity, score keeping elements, more information and problems to
        solve, and improved setting and character assets.
