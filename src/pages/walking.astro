        <h1>Why Walk?</h1>
        <p>
          Why isn't there an educational game about walkable cities? Oh wait,
          now there is!<br />

          "Why Walk?" places the player in a city with a handful of issues
          hindering a city's walkability. As the player explores each of them,
          they learn how each element impact the city's walkability and how to
          fix them. <br />
          <br />The game was designed to be simplistic to target a younger
          audience for educational purposes. The project is completely written
          in JavaScript using P5.play library. Assets were obtained through free
          online sources. <br />
          <br />I'm interested in further improving this game with added
          interactivity, score keeping elements, more information and problems
          to solve, and improved setting and character assets.
